- Add tooltips to everything with explanations
- Replace ranges used for random number generation with a "ValueSelector", which allows a literal, a range and a ValueHandler/Variable. The range can also use ValueHandler/Variable for the limits.
- Change numbers in most definitions (conditions, for example) by something that can be either a ValueHandler, a Variable, a literal, or a function, with a property drawer, etc
- Unify ValueHandler/Value with single selector that can take any of them
- Add HueShift/Outline effect for sprites
- Add LookAt action
- Warning/Error system
  - Error: Set scene object to prefab
  - Warning: No actions
  - Warning: No probabilities set for ActionRandom
  - Warning: No tags set for OnCollision
  - Warning: Change values with deltaValue = 0
- Movement targets should be redefinable
- Comment Code
- Documentation

Usability:
----------
- Highlight action by clicking/scroll there (not sure if possible)
- How to make simple actions more accessible? (see Simple Usage)
- Add a tree view to explore objects in the games
  - Add triggers/actions directly in the objects
  - Have the ability to have custom adds (SetVisibility, SetVelocity, etc)
- Add node ID property to actions/triggers
- Enable debug system for nodes 
- No info on tagged actions
- Value Display Text should use a formatting string instead the text in the edit box

Simple usage:
-------------
- Maybe create a wizard?
- Set object visible/invisible
- Set object velocity

Videos:
-------
- Ricochet bullet
- Look at player

Bugs:
-----
- Collision detection fails because of using RigidBody2D.MovePosition() instead of actual physics
- Preserve velocity with Movement

Polish:
-------
- Rounded corners on title boxes

Games:
------
- Add sounds to most games
- Add animations to Commando game
- Create FlagCatcher game
- Create UI game (strategy, need to think about this a lot)
- Create SpyGame (add AI system - StateMachine)
- Create Driving (add AI system - Markov chains)
- Create Commando 2 game (add AI system - 2d path finding)
- Create Visual Novel game
